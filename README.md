* Open **aliases** file which is located inside **PentestBox Directory/config** with any text editor.
* Now locate the tool by searching with it's name like for in your case , locate **instarecon** line.
* It should appear like **instarecon=python "%pentestbox_ROOT%\bin\InformationGathering\instarecon\instarecon.py" $***
* Now if you want to use **insta** or some other word to use the tool InstaRecon then just replace **instarecon** with your word , in our case **insta**
*Finally that line should like **insta=python "%pentestbox_ROOT%\bin\InformationGathering\instarecon\instarecon.py" $***
* Save the file and restart PentestBox to see effect.
