<p>If you move your cursor along it edges then outer boundary start appearing and you can resize using it but this procedure is something everyone is not able to follow.</p>

<p>There is an alternative way to do this</p>

<ul>
<li>Right click on the top bar and then click on settings.</li>
<li>Then a new window will appear then uncheck “Hide caption Always” and then save settings as given below.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/z38sDac.png" alt="">
</li>
<li><p>You can now resize the window as you would like. After that you can again go to setting and check that option again and save settings.
PentestBox will save your current windows size and will open as it is when you open next time.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Metasploit Contains exploits/payloads inside it, so when installed on windows machines nearly all antiviruses and firewalls put up warnings. Also Metasploit officially instruct to disable antiviruses and firewalls while using it. </p>
<p>So in order to make PentestBox work without switching off any antiviruses program, we have not included that. But if you willing to switch off your antiviruses program and want to use Metsaploit on Windows, you can download windows installer for Metsaploit from officially <a href="http://www.rapid7.com/products/metasploit/download.jsp" target="_blank">Metsaploit website</a>. It's own installer works really great on windows.</p>

<ul>
<li>Actually PentestBox is packed by UPX which is identified as malware by some antivirus softwares. You can scan PentestBox.exe with virustotal.com and see the result. As an alternative there is a PentestBox.bat file in the same directory which upon running won’t show any warnings. There are some ruby gems also which can also flag as virus/malware. Also THC-SSL-DOS will also be flagged because of it's action against SSL servers. 
<p>If you worried about those warnings then you can allow your Antivirus to remove those files, in that case you can start PentestBox through PentestBox.bat file and THC-SSL-DOS will not work. Rest other tools/products will work normally.</p>

<a id="how-to-change-aliases" class="anchor" href="#how-to-change-aliases" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How to change aliases</h2>

<p>If you consider that the terminal command mapping is not rememberable and want to change anyone of it. Like for example if you want that Instarecon should be operational by entering <strong>insta</strong> instead of <strong>instarecon</strong>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Create a file with name <strong>customaliases</strong> and place it in <strong>PentestBox Directory/bin</strong>. Please note file should not have any extension.</li>
<li>Now if you want to use <strong>insta</strong> or some other word to use the tool InstaRecon then just place <strong>insta=python "%pentestbox_ROOT%\bin\InformationGathering\instarecon\instarecon.py" $*</strong> in <strong>customaliases</strong> file.</li>
<li>Save the file and restart PentestBox to see effect.</li>
<li>Now you would be able to use both aliases, that is <strong>insta</strong> and <strong>instarecon</strong> in our case.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note: alias is case sensitive</strong></p>
