So it has been advised by Rapid7(Company which developed Metasploit) to switch off firewalls and antiviruses or put Metasploit as an exception in Firewall while using it. If you do not want to switch off your antiviruses and firewalls and also keen to use PentestBox then you have to remove Metaploit or put Metasploit folder in antivirus exceptions list. Metaploit in located in **PentestBox Directory\\bin\\Metasploit**.\r\n\r\n##How to include your own Tool\r\n\r\nIf you want to include a tool which is not currently present in PentestBox then below are the ways to include it.\r\n\r\n* If it is Python based program\r\n  * Place that folder in **PentestBox_Directory/bin** or in any folder inside bin.\r\n  * As Python is configured inside PentestBox, you can directly go to that directory and then run that program by prepending **python** to the filename.\r\n  * But if you want to set an alias for that program then please follow **How to add an alias**\r\n* If it is Ruby Based Program\r\n  * Place that folder in **PentestBox_Directory/bin** or in any folder inside bin.\r\n  * As Ruby is configured inside PentestBox, you can directly go to that directory and then run that program by prepending **ruby** to the filename.\r\n  * But if you want to set an alias for that program then please follow **How to add an alias**\r\n* It it is Executable file\r\n  * Place that folder in **PentestBox_Directory/bin** or in any folder inside bin.\r\n  * You can directly access by moving to that folder and typing the filename.\r\n  * But if you want to set an alias for that program then please follow **How to add an alias**\r\n\r\n##How to change aliases\r\n\r\nIf you consider that the terminal command mapping is not rememberable and want to change anyone of it. Like for example if you want that Instarecon should be operational by entering **insta** instead of **instarecon**.\r\n\r\n* Open **aliases** file which is located inside **PentestBox Directory/config** with any text editor.\r\n* Now locate the tool by searching with it's name like for in your case , locate **instarecon** line.\r\n* It should appear like **instarecon=python \"%pentestbox_ROOT%\\bin\\InformationGathering\\instarecon\\instarecon.py\" $***\r\n* Now if you want to use **insta** or some other word to use the tool InstaRecon then just replace **instarecon** with your word , in our case **insta**\r\n*Finally that line should like **insta=python \"%pentestbox_ROOT%\\bin\\InformationGathering\\instarecon\\instarecon.py\" $***\r\n* Save the file and restart PentestBox to see effect.\r\n\r\n**Note: alias is case sensitive**\r\n\r\n##How to add aliases\r\n\r\nIf you want to add your own alias for a program/tool then please follow the steps below.\r\n\r\n* Open **aliases** file which is located inside **PentestBox Directory/config** with any text editor.\r\n* Now add your program/tool by adding alias on left side then an **=**, and then\r\n  * If an Python file, please put **python** after **=** and then location to filename.\r\n    For Example, **theHarvester=python \"%pentestbox_ROOT%\\bin\\InformationGathering\\theHarvester\\theHarvester.py\" $***\r\n  * If an ruby file, please put **ruby** after **=** and then location to filename.\r\n    For Example, **wpscan=ruby \"%pentestbox_ROOT%\\bin\\WebApplications\\wpscan\\wpscan.rb\" $***\r\n  * If it is an executable file , then just put path to the file.\r\n    For Example, **lazagne=\"%pentestbox_ROOT%\\bin\\password_attacks\\LaZagne\\Lazagne.exe\" $***\r\n  * If it is a bash Script, then prepend **sh** to the file path.\r\n    For Example, **wifi_honey=sh \"%pentestbox_ROOT%\\bin\\Sniffing\\wifi_honey\\wifi_honey.sh\" $***\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
